I'm a final-year PhD student in the Oxford Protein Informatics (OPIG) and CompStats & Machine Learning (OxCSML) groups. My research focuses on developing **more robust and data-efficient generative models** for applications in early-stage drug discovery and protein design. Specifically, I’m interested in improving out-of-distribution generalisation ([ICML 2023](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/klarner23a/klarner23a.pdf), [ICML 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11942)) and generative modelling under domain-informed constraints ([TMLR, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05364), [NeurIPS 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05439.pdf)).

This work requires familiarity with both modern deep learning and the realities of practical drug discovery, which I have been fortunate to pick up from my supervisors **Yee Whye Teh (Oxford/DeepMind)**, **Charlotte Deane (Oxford)** and **Garrett Morris (Oxford)**, as well as Torsten Schindler and Michael Reutlinger (Roche). My work is funded by a **Clarendon Scholarship** (Oxford's flagship academic merit scholarship for graduate students) and additional partnership awards from Brasenose College, Oxford and Roche.

I feel strongly about **understanding the data I work with** and have spent many weeks in ChEMBL and PubChem. I am also interested in curating **more realistic datasets and benchmarks** ([ICML 2023](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/klarner23a/klarner23a.pdf), [AI for Chemistry Best Poster Award](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Gc5oq8sr6A3&)) and am a main contributor of the open-source Gauche package ([NeurIPS 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04450)).

Before starting my PhD, I completed a BSc. in Interdisciplinary Sciences (chemistry, biology and CS) at ETH Zürich. During this time, I had the opportunity to design and synthesise antimicrobial peptides with Prof Gisbert Schneider and engineer bacteria for targeted cancer therapy with Prof Simone Schürle-Finke.
