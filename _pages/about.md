I'm a final-year PhD student in the Oxford Protein Informatics (OPIG) and CompStats & Machine Learning (OxCSML) groups. My research focuses on developing **more effective deep learning algorithms** that are able to leverage scientific prior knowledge and constraints to improve their **robustness and generalisation in practical drug discovery settings**. Specifically, I’ve worked on using the compositional structure of drug-like molecules to improve the OOD generalisation of molecular property predictors ([ICML 2023](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/klarner23a/klarner23a.pdf)), as well as generative modelling under domain-informed constraints ([NeurIPS 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05439.pdf)).

I feel strongly about **understanding the data I work with** and have spent many weeks in ChEMBL and PubChem. I am also interested in creating better and **more useful datasets and benchmarks** ([ICML 2023](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/klarner23a/klarner23a.pdf), [AI for Chemistry Best Poster Award](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Gc5oq8sr6A3&)) and am a main contributor of the open-source Gauche package ([NeurIPS 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04450)).

This work requires familiarity with both modern deep learning research and the realities of practical drug discovery, which I have been fortunate to pick up from my supervisors **Yee Whye Teh (Oxford/DeepMind)**, **Charlotte Deane (Oxford)** and **Garrett Morris (Oxford)**, as well as Torsten Schindler and Michael Reutlinger (Roche). My work is funded by a **Clarendon Scholarship** (Oxford's flagship academic merit scholarship for graduate students) and additional partnership awards from Brasenose College, Oxford and Roche.

Before starting my PhD, I completed a BSc. in Interdisciplinary Sciences (chemistry, biology and CS) at ETH Zürich. During this time, I had the opportunity to design and synthesise antimicrobial peptides with Prof Gisbert Schneider and engineer bacteria for targeted cancer therapy with Prof Simone Schürle-Finke.
